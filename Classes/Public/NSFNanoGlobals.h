 * If FastMode is activated, the document store is opened with all performance turned on (more risky in case of failure). Deactivating it makes it slower,
 * but safer.
 * 
 * When FastMode is activated NanoStore continues without pausing as soon as it has handed data off to the operating system.
 * If the application running NanoStore crashes, the data will be safe, but the database might become corrupted if the operating system crashes
 * or the computer loses power before that data has been written to the disk surface.
 * On the other hand, some operations are as much as 50 or more times faster with FastMode activated.
 * 
 * If FastMode is deactivated, NanoStore will pause at critical moments to make sure that data has actually been written to the disk surface
 * before continuing. This ensures that if the operating system crashes or if there is a power failure, the database will be uncorrupted after rebooting.
 * Deactivating FastMode is very safe, but it is also slower.
